> **Notice:** This code is not representative of how I program today. I've been learning a lot about proper code ettiquette, and always try my best to have readable code as of now.

# Orikivo.Classic
Orikivo's source code before its rewrite. All of its files are planned to be optimized and organized, but nothing will change. This represents the blob of concepts that Orikivo was before I planned everything together.

# Plans
My goal with Orikivo.Classic is to retain the same structure as it once had, while improving and organizing the entire code structure.
> Note: This may be held off until Orikivo's current library is complete.

## Checklist
- Place all empty classes into a file called `EMPTY_CLASSES.txt`, which only lists out all empty classes.
- Merge all duplicate classes to their best version.
- Place all files into their correct folders.
- If needed, rename classes and methods to improve readability.
- Add comments for methods to describe what was planned with certain classes.
- Make the library executable once again.
- Give credit for libraries/repositories referenced at the time where due.

Have fun discovering the past! I know I won't.
